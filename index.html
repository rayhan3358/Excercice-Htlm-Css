        <p>In nature, <span class = "good">Good</span>& Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither good or bad?</p>

        <p>
        <strong> In life there are 4 types of people.</strong><br>
        <ul>
           <li>people who think the Internet is <span class ="good">good</span>,</li><br>
           <li>people who think the Internet is evil,</li><br>
           <li>people who think the Internet is cats,</li><br>
           <li>people who don't think about it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> In space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face.<br> 
            From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter,nothing cares about your problems.<br> 
            Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.<br>
            Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. <br>
            Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. <br>
            Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message.<br> 
            That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. <br>
            That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example.<br> 
            If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.<br> 
            Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.<br>
            They’re proofs to that. <br>
            Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine.<br> 
            Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently.<br> 
            But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. <br>
            Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

        <h2>Story</h2>

       <img src ="Vie.jpg" alt="The Old Chinese Farmer" width="400px"/>

       <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. <br>
        That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br> 
        They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. <br>
        This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Is it <span class ="good">good</span>? Is it <span class = "bad">bad</span>? I don't know.” <br>
        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky.<br> 
        What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Is it <span class ="good">good</span>? Is it <span class ="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.” <br>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. <br>
        The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Is it <span class ="good">good</span>? Is it <span class ="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.<br>
        ” The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.<br>
        Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Is it <span class ="good">good</span> ? Is it <span class ="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”<br>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, <br>
        and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class ="good">good</span>or <span class ="bad">bad</span>— because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; <br>
        or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.<br>

                <p>Conclusion<br>
                    <span class ="good">Good</span> and <span class ="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. <br>
                    Bananas are <span class ="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class ="good">good</span>for bananas. <br>
                    Let's not make a big deal out of it...
